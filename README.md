# Tools for Animating Rigs made with fossil

GUI access to switching and switch profiles.

## Installation

The easiest way is to use the [mayaHooks](http://github.com/patcorwin/mayaHooks) installer, which is done by saving [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patcorwin/mayaHooks/master/mayaHooksInstaller.mel) as `.mel` file, ex `mayaHooksSetup.mel` and dropping it into a maya viewport.

Once you have the installer, paste this url `http://github.com/patcorwin/fossilAnimTools` into the "Install from Url" field.

You will also need to install fossil: `http://github.com/patcorwin/fossil`

The hard way is manually downloading these packages, placing them in a scripts path and doing some other stuff to make sure the icons are found.
